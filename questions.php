                        <p class="para-cm">Will you be comfortable despite the lack of protection that hierarchy provides in other organizations? For example, in our company, juniors who are your team members may even be asked to formally rate you every quarter. Will you be open to this or will your confidence crack when faced with such unconventional processes? Do you have enough flexibility, resilience and self-confidence at this point in your life to tide over the many changes you will see? </p>

The lack of a special desk or parking space, the lack of a fancy designation even as your peers elsewhere get to be called 'National Creative Director' or 'Vice-President: Global Client Services'…Will it bother you that when you travel, you will stay in modest guest houses and not five-star hotels or not get an extravagant expense account? </p>

                        <p class="para-cm">An entrepreneurial company leads an uncertain life. Even though our companies are financially stable with an excellent record of profitability, people are expected to adapt to a much greater amount of change (new processes, constantly evolving professional expectations) than in most mature corporations. How comfortable are you with the idea of learning and doing things you have never done before? There is change that is predictable (for instance, that which we’ve tried to sensitize you through this document) but there may be change which is unpredictable. Are you sure you have enough confidence and self-belief to cope with unpredictable change? </p>

                        <p class="para-cm">You will have to work harder for every thousand rupees you earn in our company, much more than you would have to in a large, established company. Will this bother you or will you view it as a positive challenge?<br><br><span class="custom-purp">Large companies can afford to have dozens of well-paid people, hired only for a single purpose and sometimes even hired for a contingency. Entrepreneurial companies expect people to be multi-dimensional and manage subsidiary responsibilities apart from their main one. For many, this makes work much more interesting and challenging. For others, it is more responsibility than they can handle.</span></p>

But senior members get paid significantly less, rupee-to-rupee, than what they would in Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore. What do you think you will feel as you see the zeros at the end of your peers salaries rising faster than yours? You may be living in a much bigger house here, have a ten-minute commute to work, have much more time for leisure and family than you ever did and perhaps even save more money than in the city. But will you be mentally strong enough to know that you are happy or will you keep questioning whether you made the right choice?<br><br><span class="custom-text">Our View on Money</span><br><span class="custom-purp">We do not look to ‘industry-standards’ or ‘competition’ as the index to what we should pay our people, since salary is not only a function of the business environment and model, but is also a function of the cost of living, which in Goa, is significantly lower than in major cities in India.<br><br>We also do not have a fixed salary structure or range for each position. We are a fiscally conservative, paisa-wise entrepreneurial organization and therefore very pragmatic about what our financial capabilities are. At the same time, we are not rupee-foolish and will not forgo an exceptionally capable person for a difference that was bridgeable.<br><br>We do not have a board or external investors to answer to. But we have a more stringent authority- ourselves. Unless something makes sense for us, we won't do it. And if it makes sense to us, no rule or precedent can stop us from an immediate conclusion.<br><br>Currently, everyone gets paid a Professional Fee and only TDS is deducted from it, which is set-off and claimed as ‘Tax Paid’ against your Income Tax liability. No other deductions are made. In addition to this, each member gets a significant Tenure Bonus and a Performance Bonus, details of which will be explained in a separate document. These contribute an average of 20% over and above the Professional Fee of employees.<br><br>Business Heads also get a significant portion of the net after-tax profits pf their company or team, subject to minimum profitability. In the previous years, Business Heads have made between an equivalent of 15-40% of their Professional Fee (and over-and-above it) from the profit-sharing program. </span></p>

Working late (after 6.30 p.m.) is formally tracked and is actively discouraged. All Saturdays and Sundays are off. Exceptions can be made only if there is an emergency at the client side or compensatory work to be done because of illness. Currently, 95% of people do not turn-up 95% of the weekends, which is the way we want it.<br><br>Besides all weekends off (104 days annually), the holiday policy allows for a comfortable number of days of full-paid leave (including Medical, Single-day and Annual). The annual leave allowance increases for every year spent in our company.<br><br>Extraordinary leave (paid or unpaid) can be granted for any number of days to account for extraordinary events—family bereavement, wedding, maternity and paternity leave—and this is decided on a case-by-case basis.
