                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>As a 'knowledge capital' company, the key differentiator we have is our people. Clients need to view our people as 'Experts' and 'Advisors' they can trust. We believe this can only be achieved by continuous investments in upgrading our skill set and knowledge.<br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>You may not like it if you believe that you have already passed the point where you need to learn. You may not like it if you resent having to invest some time after work for upgrading yourself. You may not like it if you view this expectation as an intrusion into your personal time. </p>

                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>We believe that Discipline leads to an amplification of our abilities. We also believe that Discipline is not opposed to individual freedom but that it actually facilitates greater freedom and independence for each person.<br><br>We believe that while every individual has particular ways to tackle his work and life, for an organization to achieve excellence consistently it requires that everyone in the team be coupled together with a minimum of systems and processes.<br><br>We also believe that this respect for discipline is important not only in how we approach our work but also extends to interactions with Clients or Colleagues.<br><br>We have also observed through the years that the everyday manifestations of such discipline seem to have a significant positive impact on our Clients who are extremely appreciative of even standard practices, like the fact that people from our organization almost always come to appointments on time. This is reflective of the fact that discipline matters to our clients, and is also reflective of the terrible level of discipline that seems to prevail in the Indian business environment.<br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>You may not like it if you feel that the expectation of punctuality (like coming in every morning at 8.30 a.m.) is strange in an organization of grown-ups.  Or that the organization requires written permission if anyone stays back late after 6.30p.m.  </p>

                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>Humility teaches you to become aware of what you are good at as well as reach out to people that are better than you at other things. In our organization this ensures a healthy exchange of ideas, opinions and suggestions that enhances quality of work and life.<br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>Our organization expects constant learning, and if there is an absence of humility, a person may resent having to be 'forced' to learn.<br><br>You may not like it if you rush to judge people before you have had a chance to know them, because in our company there are many people who appear ordinary in their interaction and deportment, but are extraordinary in their accomplishments.<br><br>You may not like it if you have a sense of awkwardness about learning from someone younger than you. You may not like it if you cannot accept mistakes graciously.</p>

                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>We believe respect begets respect, affection reciprocates affection. Our organization is not an elite institution. It is a community of diverse interests, cultures and personalities at different stages of evolution as human beings. <br><br>A healthy exchange of ideas, point of views and experiences can only prosper in an environment that is conducive to respect and a sense of concern for others.<br><br>As an example, emphasis is given to sensitivities of non-smokers, so smoking zones are limited and designated. The kitchen cooks only Vegetarian food, as non-vegetarians can exercise their choice by ordering food from outside or bringing food from home. A flexible holiday policy ensures that individual members can choose which festivals and celebrations they believe in and want to avail of.<br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>You may not like it if you cannot make the effort to learn more about your colleagues. You may not like it if your upbringing has not helped you internalize the belief that you are part of an ecosystem made of people with personalities, temperament, interests, motivations and aspirations different from you; but this does not make them inferior or superior to you.</p>

                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>We have an informal work culture, but there's an unwritten code of respect that we adhere to. This helps us grow relationships beyond work and builds the trust and conviction of people about each other.  This code involves respecting the fact that some people are older than us, more experienced than us or even older in our organization than us. <br><br>It reflects in the smallest of things, starting from the way we address each other. <br><br>But this does not at all mean that we need to obey anyone without question, nor does it mean that any decisions are taken for reasons other than their intrinsic merit. It just means that even when we criticize someone, or oppose a viewpoint, it should be done with an approach and tone that acknowledges the fact that the person is older or more experienced.<br><br>We have an open culture where everyone in the organization is as approachable as their work allows. We have multiple feedback systems and evaluation systems.</p>

                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>We like</span><br>(SOME) TRADITIONS</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>We like traditions, except of course, those that are anti-human or opposed to rational thought. Our organization has people from diverse ethnic, geographical, economic and cultural backgrounds. Our organization does not subscribe to any particular religious or cultural views, but admittedly it could be said to have some aspects of what is often described (with Respect or Derision) as a 'middle-class' value system. <br><br>So for example, we're a little oriented towards a more 'family-like' environment and focused more on action-oriented, pragmatic thinking rather than more abstract theorizing that has little chance of being translated into meaningful action. <br><br>We are fine with this leaning, since we have found that many of these qualities are also those that create a warm and happy environment in which most people thrive. <br><br>An organization reflects its biases most clearly through recruitment. Ours is no different.<br><br>The archetypical personality at our organization probably has many of these characteristics: Frank, Friendly and Respectful, Honest and Transparent, raises a hand to participate in whatever ways he can... <br><br>But there are many different kinds of people that are happily scattered around this archetype. For instance, a person who takes time to open-up and make friends; thinks for a little longer before responding, is a little solitary and keeps to himself should not have any reason to feel uncomfortable at our organization ; as long as he makes a little effort to come outside of himself, and respect the fact that some harmless little practices that we have here (participating in Holi for instance, or going out once in a while with colleagues to a movie), while not being mandatory are certainly important in building bridges with colleagues.<br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>You may not like it if you are impregnably solitary. Or if your formidable intellect leads you to trivialize the sentiments of fellow-humans.</p>

                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>We like</span><br>ACHIEVEMENT</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>For us, achievement is not a superficial, imitative sense of what is fashionable or 'cool'. It is deeper than that.<br><br>We know that Personality is only partly a reflection of Character. Character is often not immediately obvious.<br><br>We value and encourage demonstrated achievement and believe that performance speaks for itself. Superficial knowledge may help create shallow and clever conversations, but to be able to be seen as a 'Trusted Advisor' by clients, one needs to have depth.<br><br>Therefore, our organization wants to encourage a culture where no one feels superior just because they have a Western accent, and no one feels inferior just because their dress or deportment does not match the kind of people seen on MTV.<br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>You may not like it if you value others or overvalue yourself based on shallow criteria.</p>

                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>We like</span><br>TRUST</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>Trust is the ability to believe the larger pattern even when a few small things may not be immediately explicable. This requires a belief in the larger view of our organization as a family. <br><br>It is realistic to assume that our people will not agree with every decision. Or they will observe some action of the organization, the reason behind which will not be immediately apparent to them. This does not need to put their Trust in jeopardy.  <br><br>After a person has examined our organization carefully in the process of choosing to join us it is imperative to have an unshakeable faith in the value system. If this requires many questions to be asked, that is acceptable. What is not acceptable is to keep the questions inside you and start arriving at conclusions based on incorrect facts, without making any attempt to clarify them with people who can help you understand them or help you change them. <br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>You may not like it if you are a chronically suspicious person. You may not like it if you don't like to make the time and effort to voice disagreements systematically at the right forum. You may not like it if you don't have a belief that almost all issues can be resolved satisfactorily through dialogue. You may not like it if you do not have the capacity for trust. </p>

                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>Working at any organization involves giving up a little of what we like to do. Perhaps we have to wake up earlier than we would have otherwise, or have to sit in longer meetings than our usual capacity for attention may allow…But we cannot use these to constantly keep chafing at the 'restrictions the organization is imposing'. We need to embrace them, believing that they are a very small price in exchange for the opportunities that we get to maximize ourselves.<br><br>As just one example, non-vegetarians have to settle for a vegetarian lunch, unless of course, they choose to bring food with them from home.  We expect everyone in our organization to show a willing acceptance of the small actions of the organization that may inadvertently intrude upon your personal practices. <br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>You may not like it if you value your personal practices more than group harmony. </p>

                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>For a young evolving organization like ours where we encourage demonstrated abilities, it is imperative that every member contributes beyond a transactional relationship with the organization. We believe that you earn the right to be heard partly through your contribution to our ecosystem. We seek and solicit your participation at every group opportunity.  <br><br>Being aloof from activities here, even if one does not actively disrespect them, will end up isolating a person. Demonstrate your sense of belonging through active participation and help the organization grow. <br><br>Inculcate a habit of pointing out mistakes and taking responsibility of correcting them. Be willing to take onus for the suggestions you make and see them through.<br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>You may not like it is you are a loner. </p>

                        <p class="para-cm"><span class="custom-text">Why we like it</span><br>We all need to adapt to a better way of working, but this systematic approach should not be seen as a threat to your 'creative' freedom or uniqueness as an individual. <br><br>From you we expect an unfailing faith that while we may need to improve a process or substitute a better one in its place, but the overwhelming number of things that we do professionally will lend themselves to a process. We also expect you to actively leverage the processes and tools that have been created within the organization, and also suggest alternatives where you feel that any system or process followed in our organization is wrong or inefficient. We also expect you to willingly make changes to your personal habits (e.g. waking up Early to come to office by 8.25 a.m.) to help the organization achieve the larger goals. In the case of this example, the goal is to help aid work-life balance by ensuring everybody leaves office by 5.30 p.m. <br><br><span class="custom-text">Why you may not like it</span><br>You may not like it if you have consistently found yourself displaying a resistance to orienting your work around any </p>
