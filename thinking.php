                <p class="para-cm" style="text-align: center;">You’ve gone through material that has explained to you about how our organization works and what we value. Here are a few pointers that will help you put things in perspective:</p>
            </div>
            <div id="mp-carousel" class="mp-carousel carousel slide carousel-fade" data-ride="carousel">
                <div class="carousel-inner">
                    <div class="item active">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider01.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>Yes you can retain your</span><br>INDIVIDUALITY!</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">Don’t be too worried about the charts, documents and presentations you may have gone through as a part of the recruitment process. No one is forced to immerse themselves into our culture and adopt it without question. You are encouraged to point out shortcomings, suggest changes from your experience, and at the end, willingly embrace this culture as being yours. <br><br>The key is that each person must maintain his individuality while adding colour and depth to our unique organizational culture. <br><br>We not only accept diversity, but actively encourage it in terms of gender, professional background and education. We usually do not give too much weight to the perceived value of a prestigious university, or previous work with a sought-after company.  We look for evidence of general intelligence, sincerity, honesty, knowledge of their own field, ambition, dedication and a track record of achievement. <br><br>At our organization, intelligence, youth, energy, willingness to work and diversity is sought after and nurtured because we know that this is the only engine of innovation.
                        <br><br><span class="custom-text">Will you embrace our culture or adopt it because you have to?</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider02.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>Be</span><br>RESULT-ORIENTED</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">What counts in our organization are results, not so much a particular personal style. Members and teams are supposed to deliver results to our clients in an environment of freedom and flexibility. Those who deliver results will find rewards not only in terms of money, but also an increase in responsibility, confidence, learning and trust. A strong result orientation will allows diversity <br><br>of approach, thinking and style, which in turn will promote innovation. That’s what we want from you. 
                        <br><br><span class="custom-text">Are you sufficiently result-oriented?</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider03.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>Focus on </span><br>SOLUTIONS,<br>not THEORIES</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">We do not want people who can make very intelligent post-mortem comments about what went wrong. We need people who can change things for the better. We want those who are a part of the solution, not just sit back after defining the problem.<br><br>As Theodore Roosevelt said in a speech called ‘Citizenship in the Republic: The Man in the Arena’:<br><br><i>“It is not the Critic who counts, nor the one who points out how the strong man stumbles, or how the doer of deeds could have done them better. Glory belongs to the man who actually fights in the arena, his face marred by dust and sweat and blood. Who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again; because there is no effort without error and shortcoming. Who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails with daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.”</i>
                        <br><br><span class="custom-text">Are you a spectator or a player?</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider04.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm">INNOVATION<div>is the heart of our work</div></h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">Our organization is a very strange organization from the corporate point of view. It takes a huge leap of faith for our clients to work such an unusual group of companies like ours. Therefore, we realize that our survival depends only upon our ability to be exceptional. Even though we do not set any specific ‘innovation targets’, members should realize that creating innovation is everyone’s job. Innovation or generating new ideas is therefore a part of the ‘job description’ and the contribution of all members will be evaluated on their record of innovation.
                        <br><br><span class="custom-text">Are you bubbling with ideas? </span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider05.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><div>No effort should</div><div>be required for our</div>HUMAN-CENTERED<br>PRACTICES</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">Giving fair credit for idea generation, devolved leadership, empowerment of even the junior-most staff…all of these are a part of our human-centered management practices. But our organization tends to take these for granted since the assumption is that we are good human beings and therefore this must be reflected in every part of our organization. So don’t feel that you have to try too hard to adhere to these practices. If you are the right kind of person, they will come naturally to you. And if you are not, then this is not the right kind of place for you.
                        <br><br><span class="custom-text">Do these practices come naturally to you?</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider06.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>Culture of</span><br>FREEDOM &<br>EXPERIMENTATION</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">Our organization gives people a high-degree of freedom to do what they want to do and how they do it. It acts like an investment and resource supplier to the teams. Each team has autonomy and flexibility to innovate as long as they deliver business results- with emphasis on efficiency. ‘Allow people to try things out, even if they make small mistakes. As long as they are not lazy mistakes. Or stupid mistakes’. This is our way.
                        <br><br><span class="custom-text">Do you have a personality that can leverage this culture? </span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider07.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>Would you like rotation of</span><br>RESPONSIBILITIES?</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">Individuals are not only allowed, but actively encouraged to change their functions, clients or area of competence. This system enables a company to find the position best suited for each person, while encouraging members to explore and grow. We look upon this as giving the more talented ones a broader canvas and better tools to work with rather than a traditional ‘climb up the corporate ladder’.<br><br>Another resulting benefit is that the people can stay with our organization for longer periods while maintaining freshness in their approach to work and to clients. The elevation is on merit and results delivered within this organization, regardless of the educational background, degrees, experience or recognition by outside organizations. What counts are results delivered here, while working within the parameters of our culture.<br><br>Holding people hostage to an organizationally defined core competence will bind them down. It is far more productive to create strengths around people and processes.
                        <br><br><span class="custom-text">Are you comfortable with changing functions and responsibilities?</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider08.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>Will you invest in continuous</span><br>PROFESSIONAL<br>IMPROVEMENT?</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">At our organization, developing the capability of the individual is paramount. We realize that our job is to provide resources, programs and facilities that go to making a learning organization. But each individual brings his own learning dynamics. Learning is an individual responsibility. <br><br>Therefore we have to take people who are not only willing to learn, but those who want to learn. There is no training facility in the world that can ‘teach’ an unwilling participant. It comes primarily from individual’s spirit of experimentation, personal initiative and originality.
                        <br><br><span class="custom-text">Will you invest the time and effort to learn?</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider09.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>Culture of Participative</span><br>MANAGEMENT,<br>clear DECISION<br>taking</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">We lay great stress of development of the best and most efficient systems and processes within a Team. But the systems and process documents are intended to be a starting point- a standard below which we do not want to fall. Individuals are encouraged to use the systems, learn from their peers, but also come up with their own way of managing their projects and their teams.<br><br>Our people are encouraged to engage in an open, constructive debate on their ideas with any individuals regardless of ‘level’. They are also encouraged to ask questions even if they do not deal with their own work. But what is very clear is where the responsibility and consequently the decision-making power lie. We often say that ‘Our organization is a Democracy in participation but an Autocracy in decision-making’. What this means is that while an issue will be open to discussion and debate for everyone, the decision will be taken by the person who has the final responsibility of delivering on that area of work.
                        <br><br><span class="custom-text">Are you comfortable with this style of management?</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="item">
                        <img class="slider-img" src="img/thinking/thinking-slider10.png" alt=" ">
                        <h4 class="heading-cm"><span>Be evaluated on</span><br>IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
                        <p class="para-cm">‘Leaders’ are evaluated on broadly two parameters- (a) Achievement of Results and (b) their success in implementing and furthering the Systems, Processes and Culture. While both are equally important, it must be remembered that the second without the first is often tolerable, but the first without the second is not acceptable.
