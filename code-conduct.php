If I have a grievance of any kind relating to my work or my team-mates, I will-as the very first step before speaking to anyone else bring the problem to the notice of my Business Head, my Mentor or the Director of the company, Gourav Jaswal</li>

However, even if people from my organization become close friends, I will resist the temptation to share and discuss work-related    problems with them, because I understand that in a small organization like ours it can create a complex web of opinions Which negatively affect people's perception of each other</li>

If I share this honestly, I will get due notice, an honorable and dignified farewell and the organization will respect the privacy of the reasons which made me leave</li>
                <li class="para-cm box-list-li">I know that many other organizations may find it acceptable that employees disrespect the company or its people while   continuing to work there. But this is not acceptable in this organization. I understand that if I show no evidence of wanting to improve things and am not resigning from the company, I have no right to comment negatively about the  organization or any of its members inside or outside of office. Any breach of this will result in immediate termination on  disciplinary grounds, without the benefit of any notice or financial dues to me. This will be treated as a dismissal and not    a resignation from employment and will carry all the legal and financial consequences of a dismissal.</li>
